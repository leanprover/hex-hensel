/-!
JSONL emit driver for the `hex-hensel` oracle.

`lake exe hexhensel_emit_fixtures` writes one JSONL record per
fixture component (the `(p, k)` pair, the target polynomial, and each
input factor) followed by one `result` record carrying Lean's lifted
factor array.  The companion oracle driver
`scripts/oracle/hensel_pari.py` reads the same stream and re-runs each
lift through PARI's `factorpadic`.

`python-flint` does not expose mod-`p^k` polynomial factorisation, so
the oracle for the multifactor Hensel lift is PARI (via cypari2)
rather than FLINT.

/-- A multifactor Hensel-lift fixture.

`f` is the target polynomial in `Z[x]` (coefficients ascending).  Each
entry of `factors` is a small representative of a factor of `f` modulo
`p`; `multifactorLiftQuadratic` lifts these to factors of `f` modulo
`p^k`.  `lift` carries the `[ZMod64.Bounds p]` instance so the case
table can mix primes. -/
